This Move Planner app works using AJAX requests to query external APIs to fetch and display information about a place that the user may want to know more about, like for instance, a new city that they want to move to. The user needs to enter the complete address â€“ the street, city and the state - in the form and once it is submitted the app displays the Google street view image of the  given address in the background, the geographical location of the address on the map, the current weather information for the city, the list of relevant Wikipedia article titles with links to the full article about the city and news articles about the city published in the recent past. For this purpose, it uses JQuery to manipulate the DOM elements and query the Google Street View Image API, Google Maps Embed API, Wunderground weather API, MediaWiki API and the New York Times Article API respectively using the information entered in the form, when it is submitted. The web app is also fully responsive.
